# Vectors

## Position Vectors

A 3d vector is often written as: $A =$ $\begin{pmatrix}
x \\
y \\
z \\
\end{pmatrix}$

it may also be written as: $A = (x, y, z)$

## Vector Lines

a vector line is written as:

$$
 ⁍
$$

For the equations here.. we use the vector provided by $\lambda (B-A)$ while often choosing whether to keep lambda

the perpendicular line vector to A is where: 

$$
⁍
$$

another way of writing it is:

$$
⁍⁍⁍⁍
$$

## Angle Between Vector Lines

$$
⁍
$$

which can be rewritten to:

$$
cos \theta = \frac{a \cdot b}{|a||b|}
$$

### Example 1:

A = 2, 2, -1

B = 5, -3, 2

find the angle between these two vectors:

$|A| = \sqrt{2^2 + 2^2 + (-1)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 4 + 1} = \sqrt{9} = 3$

$|B| = \sqrt{5^2 + (-3)^2 + 2^2} = \sqrt{25 + 9 + 4} = \sqrt{38}$ 

$a \cdot b = [2\times5] + [2\times-3] + [-1\times2] = 2$

$cos \theta = \frac{a \cdot b}{|A||B|} = \frac{2}{3 \times \sqrt{38}}$

$cos \theta = 0.108$

$\theta = cos^{-1} (0.108) \approx 84 \degree$
